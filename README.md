'Practice Makes Perfect' is a boxing expansion modification for the game Cyberpunk 2077. Practice boxing with Coach Fred's sparing robot whenever you'd like, as many times as you'd like.

The features of this mod:

- Once you've beaten the sparring bot once and Coach Fred has briefed you on the boxing tournament, the "Let's go again" prompt to fight the bot when you lose to it at the beginning of the game is now an additional prompt option Coach Fred has when sitting on the bench in the H10 Megabuilding after Act 1 of the game.

- Custom "Practice Makes Perfect" quest phase.

- Level scaling.

- Includes localization(translations) for every language.
